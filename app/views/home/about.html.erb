		<h2>About this Application</h2>
		<p>This application was created to explore the use of ArcGIS Server in conjunction with a Ruby on Rails application. </p>
		<p>While I learned quite a bit, I must say that I would not go aout of my way to work with ArcGIS Server using Ruby. This is likely
		because my Ruby chops are not that hot, and every single thing I did involved a lot of Google.</p>
		<p>On the upside, the Ruby community is great, and although there is a certain level of dislike to SOAP services, this project
		shows that it is possible (despite having to get up close and really personal with the underlying Xml).</p>
		<h2>About the code...</h2>
		<p>The code for this application will be pushed up to GitHub. I used the arcserver.rb project as a starting point for some of my code. I'm
		no planning on pushing that back into a fork of that project because what I ended up with is so very very tied to my project that it's not
		worth pushing back up. I suppose some refactoring could help clean things up a little, but I'm really tight for time, so feel free to pull out
		that code and push it into your own fork of arcserver.rb.</p>
